# Proposed Hierarchical Structure for World-Building



Example Structure:
Region (e.g., "Northern Kingdom")
City/Town (e.g., "Capital City")
Neighborhood (e.g., "Downtown")
Landmark (e.g., "Great Mountain")

   - The overarching category containing all other geographical and cultural features.
1. **Geographical** (General Category)
   - Continent/Ocean
     - Region
       - Landmark
       - Settlement
         - Neighborhood
   - Geographical Feature
   - Environment
     - Climate Zone (e.g. temperate, arctic)
     - Terrain Type (e.g., plains, mountains)
8. **Character**
   - **Person**
   - **Deity**


4. **Political**
   - **Country** (linked to Areas)
   - **Political Faction** (linked to Countries or Organizations)
   - **Government Types**
   - **Laws and Regulations**
   - **International Organizations** (e.g., alliances, treaties)

5. **Economics**
   - **Economic System** (e.g., capitalism, socialism)
   - **Trade Routes** 
   - **Major Industries**
   - **Currency Types**

6. **Culture**
   - **Philosophy** (including Religion as a subcategory)
   - **Art** 
   - **Traditions and Customs**
   - **Language**

7. **History**
   - **Event** (with date)
   - **Period** (with start and end dates)
       - **Types of History** (political, military, cultural, etc.)
         - would be a tagging system
           

9. **Mythology and Lore**
   - **Legends** 
   - **Mythical Creatures**
   - **Cultural Myths**

## Tagging and Linking System
- Each entry will utilize a tagging system to associate it with relevant categories, periods, and types.
- This Tagging system will be explicated in a separate project.
- Ensure that **History** entries are date-tagged and linked to their corresponding **Area** or **Event** categories.
- Implement a linking system for all objects (e.g., settlements linked under both Geography and Politics) to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Summary
This hierarchy provides a structured yet flexible framework for your world-building project, allowing for the gradual addition of detail while accommodating diverse elements such as geography, politics, culture, and history. It emphasizes the relationships between different components, fostering a rich, interconnected world that users can explore and expand collaboratively.
