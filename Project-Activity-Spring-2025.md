This file documents the activity for Spring 2025.  Currently a stub.

**Performance** 
In late April 2025, we will perform Shadow Puppet #2.  We extend the narrative tale of the two brothers and their search for enlightenment.  

**World Building**
The project requires a lore book so that we can create continuity within the BSP world.  Many researchers will be adding to this informatoin.  
Currently teh public facing page for this is on WorldAnvil.  We intend to link this to an equivalent GitHub Wiki so we can use teh Github assets to manage this.  
This project then requires developing or installing appropriate export API's so that WOrldAnvil can be populated automatically (or close to it.  This in itself is a research Project)

**Fabrication**
We will be working with digital resources to design and generate more puppets that can be used in the performance.
