# Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Project

The **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Project** is an expansive cross-disciplinary meta-project that explores shadow puppetry in all its aspects.  Projects span artistic, engineering, technological, narrative, and management activities, and create deliverables across the disciplines.  The BSP meta-project also serves as a test bed to evaluate the Balanced Blended Space framework through the development of an open source Blended Reality Performance System. The project is rooted in the identification and respectful transformation of cultural and historical traditions, particularly those related to shadow puppetry, into new, imaginative narratives and creations. In order to ensure continuity across the many modalities, a major focus is the construction of a cohesive fictional world canon.  Students and faculty from all departments are invited to participate.

## Overview

The BSP Project invites collaboration across all possible art forms, including but not limited to performing arts, computer games, visual storytelling, and more. Each contribution begins with the investigation of a culture or tradition, and through thoughtful and respectful adaptation, becomes a part of our fictional world. The project also focuses on the following core areas:

- **Cultural and Historical Research**: Investigating traditional shadow puppetry forms, their historical and cultural contexts, and transforming them into new, original narratives.
- **World-Building**: Expanding the BSP universe by developing its history, cultures, economies, and more, ensuring that all contributions are integrated into a cohesive and respectful world canon.
- **Multi-Modality Creation**: Exploring different modalities—performance, gaming, visual media, and more—to extend the narrative and reach of the BSP world.
- **AI Collaboration**: Engaging AI as a collaborator to co-create in various forms of media, blending physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces.

## Key Components

The BSP Project is structured around several ongoing efforts:

- **Cultural Research and Transformation**: Each project begins with deep research into a specific culture or tradition, particularly focusing on those with connections to shadow puppetry. This research forms the basis for new creations.
- **World Canon Development**: The BSP universe is built through ongoing world-building efforts, covering aspects like religion, economics, geography, flora and fauna, families, and social structures. However, contributions must be vetted to ensure they do not conflict with the existing world canon.
- **Multi-Modal Art Forms**: In addition to traditional puppetry, the BSP Project explores media such as computer games, visual storytelling, music, art forms, and more, each contributing to the fictional world in unique ways.
- **Vetting Process for Canon Integration**: All contributions to the world canon must be carefully reviewed (process TBD) to ensure they align with the established canon and do not contradict existing elements.

## World Canon Development

The fictional universe of the BSP Project is continuously developed through collaborative research and thoughtful transformation. Some of the areas currently being fleshed out include:

- **Religious and Economic Systems**: Development of spiritual practices, currencies, trade systems, and societal structures within the BSP universe.
- **People, Families, Countries, and Regions**: Detailed exploration of cultures, families, and the political landscapes that shape the world.
- **Geographical Formations**: Maps, terrains, and ecosystems that define the physical space of the BSP universe.
- **Art, Music, and Culture**: Expanding the creative traditions of the world through visual and performing arts, music, and other cultural expressions.
- **Flora and Fauna**: The plants, animals, and ecosystems that inhabit the world, contributing to its diversity and richness.

While contributions are encouraged, they must undergo a vetting process (details to be determined) to ensure they fit within the established canon. Each addition requires a product—whether that be artwork, research, or narrative—that is based on thoughtful and respectful research.

## Project Goals

1. **Research**: Investigate traditional shadow puppetry, cultural histories, and artistic practices.
2. **Design**: Create modular components and deliverables for various art forms, ensuring they align with the BSP world canon.
3. **Produce**: Generate original content in various forms—performances, games, media—that contribute to the BSP universe.
4. **Vet and Integrate**: Ensure that all contributions are vetted and integrated into the existing canon without conflict.
5. **Collaborate**: Engage in creative collaborations, including AI-driven projects that push the boundaries of storytelling and world-building.
