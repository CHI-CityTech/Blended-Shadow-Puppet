# Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Project

The **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Project** is an expansive cross-disciplinary meta-project that explores shadow puppetry in all its aspects.  Organized under the aegis of the Center for Holistic Integration, which promotes Projects span artistic, engineering, technological, narrative, and management activities, and create deliverables across the disciplines.  Originating in an [initial production in Spring 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/citytech-ccsd/home/blended-shadow-puppet) that merged traditional Wayang Kulit Shadow performance with 21st century technology, the BSP meta-project also serves as a test bed to evaluate the [Balanced Blended Space framework](https://sites.google.com/view/balancedblendedspace/home) through the development of an open source Blended Reality Performance System. The project is rooted in the identification and respectful transformation of cultural and historical traditions, particularly those related to shadow puppetry, into new, imaginative narratives and creations. In order to ensure continuity across the many modalities, a major focus is the construction of a cohesive fictional world canon.  Students and faculty from all departments are invited to participate.

## BSP Project Activities Overview

The BSP Project invites collaboration across diverse disciplines and art forms, including performing arts, computer games, visual storytelling, engineering, and computational design. Each contribution begins with an investigation of culture or tradition, which is then thoughtfully adapted to become part of our fictional world. The project focuses on the following core areas:

- **Cultural and Historical Research**  
  Investigating traditional shadow puppetry forms, their historical and cultural contexts, and transforming them into original narratives that honor these traditions.
- **World-Building**  
  Expanding the BSP universe by developing its history, geography, cultures, economies, and societies, ensuring that all contributions are integrated into a cohesive and respectful world canon.
- **Multi-Modality Creation**  
  Exploring diverse modalities, including performance, gaming, visual media, engineering prototypes, and computational simulations, to extend the narrative reach of the BSP world.
- **AI Collaboration**  
  Engaging AI as a creative collaborator to co-create in various media forms, blending physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces for immersive storytelling.
- **Engineering and Computational Design**  
  Developing physical and digital prototypes, interfaces, and immersive systems that integrate technology within the BSP narrative framework, enhancing interaction and experience.
- **Outreach and Integration**  
  Building partnerships, organizing events, and creating engagement materials that connect with external audiences and facilitate interdisciplinary contributions.
- **Educational Resources**  
  Creating learning materials, workshops, and curriculum modules that blend historical and creative practices, introducing shadow puppetry and cultural studies to new learners.
- **Environmental and Sustainability Research**  
  Exploring sustainable materials and practices for puppetry, set design, and digital development to align with ecological and environmental values.
- **Psychological and Social Impact Studies**  
  Investigating the effects of storytelling, performance, and immersive environments on audience perception, empathy, and cultural understanding.
- **Documentation and Archiving**  
  Developing a structured archive to preserve the project’s creative and research outputs, making them accessible for future study, expansion, and reference.
- **Balanced Blended Space and Blended Reality Performance Systems**  
  Testing the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) theoretical model through the development of Blended Reality Performance Systems. This includes investigating **combinative reality**—integrating physical and digital performance spaces to achieve a seamless, co-creative environment for human and AI collaboration.

## Key Components

The BSP Project is structured around several ongoing efforts:

- **Cultural Research and Transformation**: Each project begins with deep research into a specific culture or tradition, particularly focusing on those with connections to shadow puppetry. This research forms the basis for new creations.
- **World Canon Development**: The BSP universe is built through ongoing world-building efforts, covering aspects like religion, economics, geography, flora and fauna, families, and social structures. However, contributions must be vetted to ensure they do not conflict with the existing world canon.
- **Multi-Modal Art Forms**: In addition to traditional puppetry, the BSP Project explores media such as virtual environments, computer games, visual storytelling, music, art forms, and more, each contributing to the fictional world in unique ways.
- **Vetting Process for Canon Integration**: All contributions to the world canon must be carefully reviewed (process TBD) to ensure they align with the established canon and do not contradict existing elements.

## World Canon Development

The fictional universe of the BSP Project is continuously developed through collaborative research and thoughtful transformation. Some of the areas currently being fleshed out include:

- **Religious and Economic Systems**: Development of spiritual practices, currencies, trade systems, and societal structures within the BSP universe.
- **People, Families, Countries, and Regions**: Detailed exploration of cultures, families, and the political landscapes that shape the world.
- **Geographical Formations**: Maps, terrains, and ecosystems that define the physical space of the BSP universe.
- **Art, Music, and Culture**: Expanding the creative traditions of the world through visual and performing arts, music, and other cultural expressions.
- **World Ecosystems**: The plants, animals, and ecosystems that inhabit the world, contributing to its diversity and richness.

While contributions are encouraged, they must undergo a vetting process (details to be determined) to ensure they fit within the established canon. Each addition requires a product—whether that be artwork, research, or narrative—that is based on thoughtful and respectful research.

## Project Goals


1. **Research**: Investigate traditional shadow puppetry, cultural histories, and artistic practices.
2. **Design**: Create modular components and deliverables for various art forms, ensuring they align with the BSP world canon.
3. **Produce**: Generate original content in various forms—performances, games, media—that contribute to the BSP universe.
4. **Vet and Integrate**: Ensure that all contributions are vetted and integrated into the existing canon without conflict.
5. **Collaborate**: Engage in creative collaborations, including AI-driven projects that push the boundaries of storytelling and world-building.
