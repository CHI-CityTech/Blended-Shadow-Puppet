# Fall 2024 Activities: Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Project

During the Fall 2024 semester, the **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)** project has undertaken a series of  initiatives that merge traditional shadow puppetry with contemporary technologies. These efforts are designed to test and advance the [**Balanced Blended Space (BBS)**](https://sites.google.com/view/balancedblendedspace/home) framework by integrating human and computational intelligence in a collaborative, co-creative process. Additionally, development of the [**Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)**](https://sites.google.com/view/balancedblendedspace/blended-reality-performance-system) investigates the seamless blending of physical and virtual performance modalities, enabling new forms of immersive storytelling.  As part of this initiatie, the development of a **consistent World Canon** process will help ensure that any modality conforms to a shared history and world.  This allows unlimited investigation into our world and how to make connections to the Shadow-Puppet world.  The focus of this semester is in research, design, and speculation as we move to an implementaiton phase in Spring 2025.  We also lay the groundwork for continued project expansion, as well as a better set of procedures to introduce new activities that further expand, BSP, BBS, and CHI initiatives.

## BRPS Development
Creating foundational virtual environments, tools, and integrated systems to expand BRPS’s capabilities for supporting balanced physical-virtual collaboration.

1. **AI-Integrated Media Control** (Gonzalez): Automating dynamic media control enhances BRPS's ability to manage real-time co-creative environments.
2. **Live Sound System Development** (Navarro): Creating responsive sound systems integrates physical and virtual auditory experiences, a core aspect of BRPS.
3. **World-Building Platform Management** (Cheung): Supporting immersive storytelling environments aligns with BRPS's focus on blending physical and virtual modalities.
4. **Virtual Shadow Puppet Environment** (Wu): Developing a flat-surface virtual environment in Unity to simulate shadow puppetry dynamics, ensuring compatibility with BRPS objectives.
5. **Game Framework Development** (Wu, Cheung, Sanchez): Establishing core mechanics for multi-platform systems supports scalable BRPS-based interactions.

## BBS Investigation through AI Collaboration
Investigating the symmetrical integration of AI as a collaborative partner within the BBS framework, ensuring balanced contributions in co-creative processes.

1. **AI in Interactive Game Design** (Cheung): Co-creating game elements with AI exemplifies the BBS framework’s principles of symmetry and partnership.
2. **AI for BSP Assets** (Cheung): AI-generated assets directly contribute to BRPS while demonstrating AI's role as a creative partner, not a tool.
3. **AI in World-Building and Asset Creation** (Sanchez): Leveraging AI to develop assets integrates computational creativity into the world-building process, reflecting balanced collaboration.

## World-Building
Creating a cohesive fictional universe that supports storytelling and serves as a testing ground for BBS.

1. **Narrative Development** (Powell, Yancey, Cheung): Crafting modernized narratives aligns with BBS by integrating cultural traditions into co-creative frameworks.
2. **Character Development** (Sanchez, Powell): Developing culturally inspired characters strengthens the fictional world’s integrity within BRPS.
3. **Asset Creation** (Powell, Sanchez): Designing immersive props and environments ensures consistency in BRPS-based storytelling.

## Alternate Modality Design
Exploring new forms of creative expression to expand BSP narratives across multiple platforms, including game design as a distinct storytelling medium.

1. **Interactive Twine Game** (Cheung): Developing an interactive game using Twine, featuring AI-generated visuals.
2. **Chess-like Shadow Game** (Cordell Lane): Designing a strategy-based game inspired by shadow puppetry, bridging traditional art forms and modern gameplay.
3. **Illustrated Book Creation** (Yancey): Producing an illustrated book that features scripts, character designs, and visuals from the shadow puppet performances.

## Puppet Design
Developing puppets to enhance storytelling, with physical and virtual designs supporting both BBS and BRPS.

1. **Physical Puppet Creation** (Yancey): Expanding live performance possibilities aligns with BRPS’s physical components.
2. **Virtual Puppet Creation** (Sanchez, Powell): Creating digital puppets integrates seamlessly into BRPS virtual environments, bridging physical-virtual boundaries.

## Project Coordination and Documentation
Organizing, integrating, and preserving project outputs to ensure consistency, longevity, and scalability across the BBS and BRPS frameworks.

1. **Project Management Tools** (Begum): Enhancing resource coordination supports the development and integration of BRPS-based activities.
2. **CHIIDS (Center for Holistic Integration Integrated Digital System)** (Team-Wide Collaboration):
   - Ensures cohesive documentation and resource management for BBS and BRPS initiatives.
   - Archives digital outputs for continuity and future expansion.
   - **GitHub Development and Integration**: Centralizes codebases, asset management, and collaborative documentation to streamline version control and development workflows.
   - **OpenLab Integration**: Links resources and discussions on City Tech’s OpenLab platform to foster transparency and interdisciplinary engagement.

These diverse activities reflect the BSP project's commitment to fostering a rich, interdisciplinary approach to storytelling while serving as a test bed for the Balanced Blended Space framework and advancing the Blended Reality Performance System.
