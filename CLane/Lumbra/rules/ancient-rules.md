Lumbra is an ancient strategic game rooted in the metaphors of light and shadow. Played on a square grid board, the game combines elements of illumination, concealment, and reflection to outmaneuver the opponent. The goal is to dominate the board by harnessing light or shadow.

### **Capture Mechanics**

1. **Shadow Pieces**:
   - A shadow piece is removed from the board if it is no longer within a shadow zone at the end of a turn.

2. **Light Pieces**:
   - A light piece is removed from the board if it is no longer illuminated by a light source at the end of a turn.

### **Light and Shadow Dynamics**

1. **Light Beams**:
   - Travel in straight lines until blocked.
   - Illuminate all tiles in their path.

2. **Shadows**:
   - Created directly behind blockers relative to light sources.
   - Block illuminated tiles, returning them to neutral or shadowed states.

3. **Reflections**:
   - Mirrors and reflective tiles redirect beams to new paths.

4. **Shadow Amplification**:
   - Shadow Candles extend shadow zones to adjacent tiles.
