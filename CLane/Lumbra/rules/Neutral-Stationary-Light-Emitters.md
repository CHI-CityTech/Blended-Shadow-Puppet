# Stationary Light Emitters

## **Overview**
Stationary Light Emitters are fixed elements of the Lumbra game board. Positioned at the edges or corners of the board, these emitters provide consistent light sources that influence gameplay by illuminating tiles and interacting with both Light and Shadow side pieces. They are not movable or controllable but serve as foundational mechanics of the game environment.

## **Role in Gameplay**
1. **Illumination**:
   - Stationary Light Emitters project light across specific areas of the board.
   - Illuminated tiles are controlled by the Light side unless blocked or disrupted by Shadow side pieces.

2. **Interaction with Game Pieces**:
   - Light side pieces can extend or redirect light from the emitters using Prisms, Mirrors, or other tools.
   - Shadow side pieces can block or distort the emitters' light, creating shadow zones or neutralizing illuminated tiles.

3. **Fixed Position**:
   - Stationary Light Emitters are immovable and cannot be rotated or altered during gameplay.

## **Mechanics**
1. **Light Range**:
   - Each emitter projects a beam of light in straight lines, illuminating tiles along its path.
   - The range of illumination extends to the board's center unless obstructed.

2. **Obstacle Sensitivity**:
   - Light beams from the emitters are blocked by any piece or object in their path, creating shadow zones behind them.

3. **Directional Setup**:
   - Emitters may be oriented to provide symmetrical or asymmetrical lighting patterns, depending on the game setup.

4. **Tile Interaction**:
   - Illuminated tiles become contested zones if both Light and Shadow side pieces influence them simultaneously.

## **Strategic Implications**
1. **Light Side Advantages**:
   - Emitters provide a reliable light source, supporting Light side pieces in reclaiming or maintaining control over tiles.

2. **Shadow Side Challenges**:
   - Shadow pieces must strategically position themselves to block or disrupt the emitters' light, gaining an advantage in darkened zones.

3. **Dynamic Board Play**:
   - The stationary emitters ensure that the board remains an active environment, where light and shadow zones constantly shift due to piece movements and interactions.

## **Design Notes**
Stationary Light Emitters are integral to Lumbra's balance of light and shadow. Their consistent presence establishes a dynamic battlefield, challenging players to adapt their strategies around fixed sources of illumination.
