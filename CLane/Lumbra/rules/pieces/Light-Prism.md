# Prism

## **Overview**
The Prism is a versatile support piece for the Light side in the game of Lumbra. Its unique ability to split light beams into multiple directions makes it an essential tool for illuminating difficult-to-reach tiles and outmaneuvering Shadow pieces. Proper placement of the Prism can dramatically enhance the Light side’s control over the board.

## **Abilities**
1. **Beam Splitting**:
   - The Prism splits a single light beam into two or three separate beams, illuminating multiple paths simultaneously.
   - The split beams travel in diverging straight lines from the Prism’s position.

2. **Light Redirection**:
   - In addition to splitting beams, the Prism can redirect incoming light beams, changing their direction by 90 or 45 degrees.

3. **Beam Amplification**:
   - When illuminated by a strong light source (e.g., a Light Emitter), the Prism’s split beams extend further than usual, increasing their range.

---

## **Movement Rules**
1. **Limited Mobility**:
   - The Prism can move **one tile per turn**, either orthogonally or diagonally.
   - Movement is restricted to illuminated tiles, reflecting its dependency on light.

2. **Fixed Position Option**:
   - Once placed, the Prism can remain stationary, serving as a static support piece for redirecting and splitting light.

## **Capture Mechanic**
- The Prism is removed from the board if it is entirely surrounded by shadow at the end of a turn, symbolizing its inability to function without light.

## **Physical Construction**
1. **Base**:
   - **Material**: Carved from clear crystal or polished glass, symbolizing the clarity and purity of light.
   - **Dimensions**: Approximately **25mm to 30mm wide**, maintaining a compact footprint for versatility.
   - **Shape**: Hexagonal or triangular base, emphasizing its connection to geometric optics.

2. **Body**:
   - **Material**: Made from clear quartz or a similar transparent material, reflecting traditional craftsmanship and ancient optics.
   - **Height**: Approximately **40mm to 50mm**, proportional to its base.
   - **Shape**: A classic triangular prism with polished surfaces for optimal light manipulation.

3. **Aesthetic Details**:
   - **Symbolic Motifs**:
     - Engraved with intricate patterns representing the refraction of light, inspired by cultural motifs.
   - **Color Scheme**:
     - Clear and reflective with subtle iridescent highlights, emphasizing its connection to illumination.

## **Strategic Uses**
1. **Illuminating Multiple Zones**:
   - Place the Prism in key positions to split light beams and illuminate otherwise unreachable tiles.

2. **Countering Shadow Zones**:
   - Use the Prism to bypass or weaken large shadow zones, creating multiple points of light to disrupt Shadow side strategies.

3. **Supporting Light Emitter**:
   - Combine with Light Emitters to maximize the range and versatility of their beams.

4. **Zone Control**:
   - Position the Prism to dominate contested tiles by splitting beams across critical areas.

---

## **Weaknesses**
1. **Dependence on Light**:
   - The Prism requires an incoming light beam to function, making it ineffective on its own.

2. **Vulnerability to Shadows**:
   - Surrounded by shadows, the Prism loses its ability to manipulate light and is removed from the board.

3. **Limited Mobility**:
   - The Prism’s movement is restricted to illuminated tiles, requiring careful planning to optimize its placement.

## **Design Notes**
The Prism embodies the interplay of clarity, versatility, and enlightenment in Lumbra. Its ability to manipulate light beams provides a tactical advantage, but its dependency on proper placement makes it a challenging piece to master. Its design reflects both ancient craftsmanship and the intricate geometry of optics.
