## **Overview**
The Mirror is a strategic support piece for the Light side in the game of Lumbra. By redirecting light beams based on their angle of incidence, the Mirror allows players to manipulate light paths and reclaim contested tiles. Its design emphasizes functionality, with a short base and a prominent reflective surface.

## **Abilities**
1. **Light Redirection**:
   - The Mirror redirects incoming light beams according to the **angle of incidence**, following the law of reflection.
   - This allows beams to illuminate new paths or bypass obstacles, enhancing the Light side’s control over the board.

2. **Angle Variants**:
   - **One-Sided Mirrors**:
     - Reflect light from one side only, offering precise control.
   - **Two-Sided Mirrors**:
     - Reflect light from both sides, increasing dynamic interaction with multiple beams.

3. **Beam Combination**:
   - Multiple Mirrors can work together to create intricate paths of light, enabling advanced strategies.

## **Movement Rules**
1. **Limited Mobility**:
   - The Mirror can move **one tile per turn**, either orthogonally or diagonally.
   - Movement is restricted to illuminated tiles, reflecting its dependency on light.

2. **Rotation**:
   - The Mirror can rotate **90 degrees** per turn, allowing players to dynamically adjust its reflective angle.

---

## **Capture Mechanic**
- The Mirror is removed from the board if it is entirely surrounded by shadow at the end of a turn, reflecting its inability to function without light.

## **Physical Construction**
1. **Base**:
   - **Material**: Carved from stone, wood, or metal, reflecting traditional craftsmanship.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - **Height**: Approximately **10mm**, serving as a stable yet unobtrusive foundation.
     - **Diameter**: Approximately **30mm to 35mm**, ensuring stability without dominating the piece.
   - **Shape**: Circular or rectangular, complementing the reflective surface.

2. **Reflective Surface**:
   - **Material**: Polished metal or glass, ensuring high reflectivity.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - **Height**: Approximately **30mm to 40mm**, making it the dominant feature of the piece.
     - **Width**: Approximately **25mm to 35mm**, proportionate to the base.
   - **Angle**:
     - Fixed at **45 degrees** relative to the base for consistent redirection of light.
     - Adjustable angles may be explored in gameplay variants.

3. **Aesthetic Details**:
   - **Symbolic Motifs**:
     - The reflective surface and base are engraved with intricate patterns inspired by ancient optical tools and shadow puppetry.
   - **Color Scheme**:
     - Metallic tones such as silver, bronze, or polished steel to emphasize its reflective properties.

## **Strategic Uses**
1. **Redirecting Light**:
   - Use the Mirror to reflect light beams into shadowed zones or around obstacles, reclaiming contested tiles.

2. **Creating Light Paths**:
   - Position multiple Mirrors to form intricate paths of light, enhancing control over key areas.

3. **Supporting Light Emitters**:
   - Pair with Light Emitters to increase their reach and versatility, allowing beams to illuminate areas outside their direct path.

4. **Countering Shadow Zones**:
   - Place Mirrors near large shadow zones to redirect light and disrupt the Shadow side’s control.

---

## **Weaknesses**
1. **Dependence on Light**:
   - The Mirror requires an incoming light beam to function, making it ineffective in isolation.

2. **Vulnerability to Shadows**:
   - Surrounded by shadows, the Mirror loses its ability to reflect light and is removed from the board.

3. **Positional Sensitivity**:
   - The effectiveness of the Mirror depends heavily on its placement and the angles of light incidence.

---

## **Design Notes**
The Mirror is a symbol of adaptability and ingenuity in Lumbra. Its ability to manipulate light beams provides a significant tactical advantage, while its dependence on precise placement and alignment requires skillful planning. The short base and prominent reflective surface emphasize its functionality and aesthetic alignment with the game’s ancient roots.
