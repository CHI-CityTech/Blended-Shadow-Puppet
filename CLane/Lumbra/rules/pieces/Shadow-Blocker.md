## **Overview**
The Shadow Blocker is a vital piece for the Shadow side in the game of Lumbra. It is designed to cast large, obstructive shadows across the board, blocking light beams and reclaiming illuminated tiles. Its placement, orientation, and movement are critical to disrupting the Light side’s strategies.

---

## **Abilities**
1. **Shadow Projection**:
   - The Shadow Blocker casts a shadow directly behind it, blocking light beams and creating shadow zones.
   - The size and shape of the shadow depend on the Blocker’s orientation and proximity to light sources.

2. **Light Disruption**:
   - Shadows cast by the Blocker nullify illuminated tiles, turning them into shadow zones controlled by the Shadow side.

3. **Shadow Amplification**:
   - When placed near a Shadow Candle, the Blocker’s shadow can be extended or strengthened, enveloping additional tiles.

---

## **Movement Rules**
1. **Limited Distance**:
   - The Shadow Blocker can move up to **two tiles per turn**, emphasizing its slower, defensive role.

2. **Directional Movement**:
   - Movement is restricted to orthogonal (straight-line) directions.
   - The Blocker cannot move diagonally, reinforcing its role as a strategic, positional piece.

3. **Rotation**:
   - The Blocker can rotate **90 degrees** in place instead of moving, allowing the player to change its shadow projection direction.
   - Rotation counts as one of the two moves allowed per turn.

4. **Shadow Dependency**:
   - The Blocker must remain within a shadow zone or connected to a Shadow Candle; otherwise, it is removed from the board at the end of the turn.

## **Capture Mechanic**
- A Shadow Blocker is removed from the board if it is no longer within a shadow zone at the end of a turn, reflecting its dependency on darkness for survival.

## **Physical Construction**
1. **Base**:
   - **Material**: Carved from dark wood, stone, or metal to symbolize its connection to shadow.
   - **Dimensions**: Approximately **30mm to 40mm wide**, ensuring it occupies a larger footprint on the board compared to other pieces.
   - **Details**:
     - Weighted for stability, reflecting its defensive nature.

2. **Body**:
   - **Shape**: Flat and wide to maximize its shadow-casting ability.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - Height: Approximately **25mm to 35mm**, lower than the Light Emitter for thematic contrast.
     - Width: Approximately **40mm to 50mm**, emphasizing its function as a shadow caster.
   - **Orientation**:
     - Designed with a front-facing edge to indicate the direction of shadow projection.

3. **Aesthetic Details**:
   - **Symbolic Motifs**:
     - Carved with intricate patterns inspired by shadow puppet theatre, symbolizing concealment and defense.
   - **Color Scheme**:
     - Dark tones such as ebony, onyx, or weathered bronze to emphasize its shadowy role.

## **Strategic Uses**
1. **Defensive Play**:
   - Place the Blocker in front of key Shadow pieces to protect them from light beams.
   - Use it to reclaim illuminated tiles and turn them into shadow zones.

2. **Offensive Play**:
   - Position the Blocker to disrupt the Light side’s pathways, forcing them to adjust their strategies.
   - Combine with Shadow Candles to extend the Blocker’s shadow and increase its effectiveness.

3. **Zone Control**:
   - Strategically orient the Blocker to cover multiple tiles with its shadow, maximizing its control over contested areas.

---

## **Weaknesses**
1. **Dependence on Shadows**:
   - If removed from a shadow zone, the Blocker becomes vulnerable and is removed from the board.

2. **Limited Mobility**:
   - Movement is restricted to two tiles per turn in orthogonal directions.
   - The need for careful placement and repositioning slows its overall adaptability.

3. **Orientation Sensitivity**:
   - The effectiveness of the Blocker’s shadow depends heavily on its orientation and proximity to light sources.

## **Design Notes**
The Shadow Blocker represents the essence of defense and obstruction in Lumbra. Its wide, flat design and shadow-casting abilities emphasize its importance in countering the Light side’s strategies. Crafted with historical accuracy, its aesthetic connects to the ancient traditions of shadow puppetry.
