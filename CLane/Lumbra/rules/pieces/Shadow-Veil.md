# Shadow Veil

## **Overview**
The Shadow Veil is a unique support piece for the Shadow side in the game of Lumbra. It creates an aura of enhanced darkness, amplifying the effects of nearby shadows and shielding Shadow pieces from light. Its ability to manipulate the intensity and spread of shadow zones makes it a critical tool for controlling the board.

## **Abilities**
1. **Shadow Aura**:
   - The Shadow Veil generates an aura of enhanced darkness within a **two-tile radius**, strengthening existing shadows and converting partially illuminated tiles into full shadow zones.

2. **Light Dampening**:
   - The Shadow Veil reduces the intensity of nearby light beams, limiting their range and nullifying their ability to fully illuminate tiles within its aura.

3. **Shadow Amplification**:
   - When placed adjacent to a Shadow Blocker or Shadow Candle, the Veil extends their shadows by an additional tile in the direction of the existing shadow.

4. **Tile Conversion**:
   - Any illuminated tile within the Shadow Veil’s aura becomes a neutral tile, neither controlled by Light nor Shadow, unless further enhanced by Shadow pieces.

---

## **Movement Rules**
1. **Limited Mobility**:
   - The Shadow Veil can move **one tile per turn**, either orthogonally or diagonally.
   - Movement is restricted to tiles within shadow zones or adjacent to shadow-generating pieces.

2. **Aura Persistence**:
   - The Shadow Veil’s shadow aura remains active during movement, but its effects only apply to the tiles within its current range.

---

## **Capture Mechanic**
- The Shadow Veil is removed from the board if it is fully illuminated for more than one turn, symbolizing its reliance on existing shadow zones for survival.

## **Physical Construction**
1. **Base**:
   - **Material**: Crafted from dark wood or stone, reflecting traditional craftsmanship.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - **Height**: Approximately **10mm to 15mm**, keeping the base subtle and stable.
     - **Diameter**: Approximately **30mm**, providing a sturdy foundation for the veil structure.
   - **Shape**: Circular or oval, complementing the flowing design of the veil.

2. **Veil Structure**:
   - **Material**: A semi-transparent, flowing structure made from thin carved stone or layered fabric-like patterns in dark resin.
   - **Height**: Approximately **40mm**, making it taller than the base but shorter than Light Emitter pieces.
   - **Shape**: Wavy and irregular, symbolizing the ephemeral nature of shadows.

3. **Aesthetic Details**:
   - **Symbolic Motifs**:
     - Adorned with engravings of swirling darkness and abstract patterns inspired by shadow puppetry.
   - **Color Scheme**:
     - Matte black with subtle gray highlights to emphasize its connection to shadows.

## **Strategic Uses**
1. **Defensive Play**:
   - Use the Shadow Veil to shield key Shadow pieces from Light beams, prolonging their presence on the board.

2. **Expanding Shadow Zones**:
   - Place the Shadow Veil near Shadow Blockers or Candles to extend and strengthen their shadows, gaining control over larger areas.

3. **Countering Light**:
   - Position the Shadow Veil to reduce the range and intensity of Light Emitters, disrupting the Light side’s strategies.

4. **Tile Manipulation**:
   - Convert contested tiles within its aura into neutral zones, forcing the Light side to expend more effort reclaiming them.

---

## **Weaknesses**
1. **Dependence on Shadows**:
   - The Shadow Veil must remain within or adjacent to shadow zones to function effectively.

2. **Vulnerability to Persistent Light**:
   - Prolonged illumination nullifies its aura, making it a priority target for the Light side.

3. **Limited Mobility**:
   - Its movement restrictions require careful planning to maximize its impact.

## **Design Notes**
The Shadow Veil emphasizes the subtle yet powerful interplay between light and shadow in Lumbra. Its ability to manipulate and enhance shadow zones adds a layer of tactical complexity, while its flowing, ethereal design aligns with the game’s ancient aesthetic.
