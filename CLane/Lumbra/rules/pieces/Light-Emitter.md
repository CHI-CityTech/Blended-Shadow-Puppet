## **Overview**
The Light Emitter is a key piece for the Light side in the game of Lumbra. Designed to project beams of light in a single direction, it symbolizes clarity and enlightenment, countering shadows and reclaiming contested tiles on the board. Crafted with historical accuracy, the Light Emitter aligns with the game's ancient origins.

## **Abilities**
1. **Light Projection**:
   - Emits a focused beam of light in a straight line, illuminating all tiles in its path until blocked.
   - Illuminated tiles are controlled by the Light side, nullifying any existing shadows.

2. **Beam Rotation**:
   - The Light Emitter can rotate 360 degrees, allowing players to dynamically adjust its beam’s direction during gameplay.

3. **Beam Interaction**:
   - The Light Emitter can interact with Prisms or Mirrors to amplify or redirect its beam, enhancing its reach and versatility.

## **Capture Mechanic**
- A Light Emitter is removed from the board if it is no longer illuminated by any light source at the end of a turn, reflecting its dependency on light to remain active.

## **Physical Construction**
1. **Base**:
   - **Material**: Carved from wood, stone, or metal, reflecting traditional craftsmanship.
   - **Dimensions**: Approximately **35mm diameter** and **15mm height**, designed for stability and easy rotation.
   - **Details**:
     - Includes a carved groove or pivot mechanism for smooth rotation.
     - Features engraved directional markers indicating the light beam’s path.

2. **Lamp Light Source**:
   - The light source is a functional oil lamp integrated into the piece.
   - **Components**:
     - **Oil Reservoir**: A small chamber crafted from brass, copper, or ceramic, holding enough oil for sustained use.
     - **Wick**: A natural fiber wick (e.g., cotton or flax) extending from the reservoir, producing a steady flame.
   - **Dimensions**:
     - Height: Approximately **40mm to 50mm**, proportionate to the base.
     - Diameter: Approximately **10mm to 15mm**, maintaining a balanced design.

3. **Reflector**:
   - A parabolic reflector encircles the flame to focus the light in a specific direction.
   - **Material**: Polished brass or hammered metal, ensuring durability and high reflectivity.
   - **Diameter**: Approximately **15mm to 20mm**, slightly wider than the lamp for aesthetic and functional prominence.

4. **Aesthetic Details**:
   - **Symbolic Motifs**:
     - Intricate carvings inspired by shadow puppet theatre, depicting celestial or spiritual symbols.
   - **Color Scheme**:
     - Warm, natural tones such as polished brass, dark wood, or weathered stone.

5. **Functional Rotation**:
   - The piece rotates smoothly on its base, with a simple pivot mechanism to adjust the light beam.
   - The direction of the beam is visually indicated by engraved arrows or notches on the base.

## **Strategic Uses**
1. **Illuminating Zones**:
   - Reclaim contested zones or illuminate Sacred Tiles to secure victory points.

2. **Countering Shadows**:
   - Neutralize large shadow zones created by Shadow Candles or Blockers.

3. **Supporting Pieces**:
   - Pair with Prisms to split beams and illuminate multiple directions.
   - Combine with Mirrors to redirect light around obstacles, increasing tactical possibilities.

---

## **Weaknesses**
1. **Limited Directionality**:
   - The Light Emitter projects light only in a single, straight-line direction, requiring precise placement and rotation.

2. **Dependence on Open Lines of Sight**:
   - Ineffective if obstructed by pieces or board edges.

3. **Vulnerability to Shadow Pieces**:
   - Shadows cast by Blockers or amplified by Shadow Candles can nullify the Light Emitter’s effect, requiring support from other Light pieces.

## **Design Notes**
The Light Emitter is a cornerstone of the Light side’s strategy in Lumbra. Its design and mechanics embody the ancient balance between light and shadow, emphasizing its role as a beacon of clarity and enlightenment. The inclusion of an oil lamp with a functional flame enhances its authenticity, making it both visually striking and thematically consistent.
