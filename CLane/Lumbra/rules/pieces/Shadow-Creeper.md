## **Overview**
The Creeper is a stealthy infiltrator for the Shadow side in the game of Lumbra. Its ability to infiltrate illuminated zones and disable Light side defenses makes it a dangerous and versatile piece. Creepers thrive on strategy and subterfuge, disrupting the Light side’s control.

## **Abilities**
1. **Infiltration**:
   - The Creeper can move into illuminated zones undetected, ignoring Light Emitters and Guardians' auras.

2. **Sabotage**:
   - When adjacent to a Guardian, the Creeper can disable its light aura for **two turns**, leaving surrounding tiles vulnerable to Shadow influence.

3. **Shadow Trail**:
   - As the Creeper moves, it leaves a temporary shadow trail on previously illuminated tiles, disrupting Light side control for **one turn**.

---

## **Movement Rules**
1. **Stealth Movement**:
   - The Creeper can move **two tiles per turn**, diagonally or orthogonally, regardless of illumination.

2. **Shadow Dependence**:
   - While the Creeper can enter illuminated zones, it must return to a shadow zone within **three turns**, or it is removed from the board.

---

## **Capture Mechanic**
- The Creeper is removed from the board if it is illuminated by two or more light beams simultaneously, symbolizing exposure and neutralization.

## **Strategic Uses**
1. **Disabling Defenses**:
   - Use the Creeper to neutralize Guardians and create openings for other Shadow pieces to exploit.

2. **Infiltration**:
   - Move the Creeper deep into Light-controlled zones to disrupt control and force defensive plays.

3. **Shadow Creation**:
   - Leave shadow trails to reclaim tiles temporarily and confuse the Light side.

## **Weaknesses**
1. **Shadow Dependence**:
   - The Creeper must return to shadow zones periodically, limiting its ability to sustain prolonged infiltrations.

2. **Vulnerability to Light**:
   - Simultaneous exposure to multiple light beams results in immediate capture.
