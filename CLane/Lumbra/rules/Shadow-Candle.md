## **Weaknesses**
1. **Dependence on Shadow Zones**:
   - The Shadow Candle must remain in or adjacent to shadow zones to function effectively.

   - Direct exposure to strong light sources extinguishes the Shadow Candle, making it a priority target for the Light side.

3. **Limited Range**:
   - The Shadow Candle affects only tiles within one square of its location, requiring precise placement to maximize its impact.
