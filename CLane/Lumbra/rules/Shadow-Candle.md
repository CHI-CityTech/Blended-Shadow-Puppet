# Shadow Candle

## **Overview**
The Shadow Candle is a key piece for the Shadow side in the game of Lumbra. It serves a dual purpose: enhancing shadows cast by other pieces and enabling strategic targeting of Light pieces through its dim light emission.

---

## **Abilities**
1. **Shadow Enhancement**:
   - The Shadow Candle extends the reach of shadows created by adjacent Blockers or other shadow-generating pieces.
   - The extended shadow can envelop additional tiles, increasing the Shadow player’s control over the board.

2. **Targeting Light Pieces**:
   - A Light piece that becomes fully enveloped in the extended shadow and has no direct illumination is removed at the end of the turn.
   - The Shadow Candle must work in conjunction with another piece to create this effect.

3. **Dim Light Emission**:
   - Emits a faint light in one direction, strengthening shadows cast in the opposite direction.

## **Requirements and Limitations**
1. **Pre-Existing Shadow**:
   - The Shadow Candle cannot create shadows on its own.
   - It requires an adjacent shadow-generating piece, such as a Blocker, to enhance or extend shadows.

2. **Directional Use**:
   - The Shadow Candle’s dim light can only enhance shadows in the opposite direction of its emission.
   - It cannot affect shadows in directions already illuminated by other light sources.

3. **Light Interaction**:
   - If exposed to direct light in the same direction as its dim light emission, the Shadow Candle loses its enhancement ability for that turn.

4. **Range**:
   - The Shadow Candle affects only tiles within one square of its location.

## **Strategic Uses**
1. **Offensive Strategy**:
   - Position the Shadow Candle near key Blockers to extend their shadows into contested zones.
   - Use it to envelop Light pieces that are protected by distance or terrain.

2. **Defensive Strategy**:
   - Place the Shadow Candle to fortify critical areas, creating impenetrable shadow zones.
   - Protect the Shadow Candle from direct illumination to maintain its effectiveness.

3. **Coordinated Play**:
   - Combine the Shadow Candle with multiple Blockers to create overlapping shadows, maximizing control over specific areas.

---

## **Weaknesses**
1. **Dependence on Other Pieces**:
   - The Shadow Candle is ineffective on its own and requires collaboration with Blockers or other shadow-generating pieces.

2. **Vulnerability to Light**:
   - Direct illumination from Light side pieces can nullify its abilities, making it a priority target for the Light player.

3. **Limited Range**:
   - Its enhancement effect is confined to tiles within one square, requiring careful placement for maximum impact.

## **Design Notes**
The Shadow Candle is inspired by the flickering uncertainty of light and shadow. Its role emphasizes the cooperative nature of Shadow side pieces, adding depth and complexity to gameplay.
