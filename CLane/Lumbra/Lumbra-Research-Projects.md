## Introduction

Lumbra is a **meta-project** embedded within the larger **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Meta-project**, which explores the intersection of cultural narratives, artistic traditions, and technical innovations. As a fictitious game deeply rooted in the **Shadow Puppet World Canon**, Lumbra provides a rich framework for multidisciplinary exploration. The meta-project consists of distinct but interconnected activities, each of which can develop independently while contributing to the overall project.

The research centers around four primary game types: **Conceptual**, **Physical**, **Virtual**, and **Blended**. Each type represents a unique approach to the game, enabling distributed efforts across diverse fields of study.

## Game Types Overview

### Conceptual Game
The **Conceptual Game** focuses on defining and refining the rules, mechanics, and strategic depth of Lumbra. This type exists in the realm of ideas and serves as the foundation for all other game types.

- **Core Objective**: To craft and evaluate the gameâ€™s rules and mechanics in alignment with the Shadow Puppet World Canon.
- **Activities**: Rule-writing, scenario testing, and strategic analysis in conceptual space.

### Physical Game
The **Physical Game** involves the tangible realization of Lumbra through the design and creation of physical boards and pieces. This type highlights traditional craftsmanship and gameplay mechanics that rely on real-world light and shadow physics.

- **Core Objective**: To develop physical components and test gameplay in a non-digital setting.
- **Activities**: Fabrication of pieces, playtesting, and experimentation with light and shadow dynamics.

### Virtual Game
The **Virtual Game** translates Lumbra into a digital format, leveraging virtual space to explore light and shadow in ways not possible with physical components. This type enables accessibility, dynamic visuals, and complex interactions.

- **Core Objective**: To simulate and enhance the gameplay experience in virtual environments.
- **Activities**: Software development, interface design, and testing in digital platforms.

### Blended Game
The **Blended Game** integrates physical and virtual elements, creating a hybrid experience. The physical board interacts with digital systems, allowing for advanced gameplay features and synchronization across platforms.

- **Core Objective**: To merge physical and virtual gameplay into a cohesive, interactive experience.
- **Activities**: Development of intelligent boards, interactive pieces, and cross-platform synchronization.

## Conclusion

The **Lumbra Meta-Project** offers a rich, multidimensional framework for exploring game design, cultural narratives, and technical innovation. By distributing research efforts across the Conceptual, Physical, Virtual, and Blended game types, students and collaborators can contribute to a deeper understanding of the Shadow Puppet World Canon. This project not only showcases creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration but also provides a lasting legacy of the imagined interplay between Light and Shadow.
