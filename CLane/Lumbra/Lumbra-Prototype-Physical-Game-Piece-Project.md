# Prototype Project Specification for Lumbra Game Pieces

## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on creating **prototypes** of the game pieces for **Lumbra**, a game deeply rooted in the Shadow Puppet World Canon, amnd in which the pieces themselves provide the illumination or occlusion that determines gameplay. 
The proposed rules and piece functions can be found [here](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet/blob/main/CLane/Lumbra/rules/ancient-rules.md), and more specifics about current piece proposals is found below.
The prototypes will be developed as part of a class activity to explore the physical implementation of the game's conceptual mechanics. 
Students will design, fabricate, and experiment with the game pieces to better understand the interplay of **reflection**, **amplification**, and **attenuation** of light sources.

Successful pieces will then be integrated into the larger Lumbra development project, or further refined as determined by playtesting.

The project also serves as an educational exercise, allowing students to practice 3D modeling, printing, and iterative design while exploring new pieces or improving existing ones.

## 2. Project Goals

- Create **prototype game pieces** with specific dimensions and functionality for testing.
- Allow students to **speculate and design their own pieces** or adapt conceptual designs into physical forms.
- Address challenges of **light manipulation** (reflection, amplification, attenuation) through material selection and design.
- Provide hands-on experience with **3D modeling, printing, and fabrication processes**.
- Ensure that all designs are compatible with the **3D printing environment** used in class.

## 3. General Requirements

- **Scale and Dimensions**: Pieces should fit on a 10 x 10 board with tiles measuring **50 mm x 50 mm**.
  - Base dimensions: Max **45 mm x 45 mm**.
  - Height: Between **50 mm and 75 mm**, depending on piece function.
- **Material Compatibility**:
  - Use **PLA, ABS, or resin** for 3D printing.
  - Transparent or translucent materials for light-transmitting elements.
  - Opaque materials for shadow-casting or light-blocking elements.
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Moving parts should be simple and durable (e.g., hinges, rotatable bases).
  - Pieces must be **assembled post-printing**, if needed, with minimal tools.
  - Include tolerances for assembly and movement (0.5 mm gap for snap-fit joints).
