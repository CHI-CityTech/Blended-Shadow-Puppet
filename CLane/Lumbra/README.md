# ðŸŒ— Lumbra: A Game of Light and Shadow

_Lead Investiagtor: Cordell Lane._ 

**Lumbra** is a strategy board game that explores the philosophical, artistic, and mechanical interplay between **illumination and shadow**. Inspired by ancient technologies and metaphors, the game is designed as a fusion of physical gameplay and optical manipulation, where victory is determined not just by movement, but by how light and shadow shape the board.

This repository houses all development materials for **Lumbra**, including game rules, piece designs, diagrams, 3D models, and documentation of experimental mechanics.

## ðŸ§  Concept

**Lumbra** imagines a world where light and shadow are not only forces of nature, but active participants in a tactical contest. Players assume the roles of opposing forcesâ€”**Light** and **Shadow**â€”and manipulate a variety of pieces that emit, block, reflect, or absorb light.

The board itself is dynamic, with light sources and obstacles creating ever-changing conditions. The strategic depth lies in shaping the environment as much as in positioning pieces.
