## A Peek at the Current Proposed Mechanics (Subject to Updates)   

### **Basic Mechanics**

1. **Dynamic Board and Tile Effe   cts:**
   - The board layout is randomized for each game, with tiles providing effects based on lighting conditions.

2. **Tile Colors and Effects:**
   - Each tile color grants specific buffs or debuffs. For example:
     - **Red Tiles:** Boost attack.
     - **Blue Tiles:** Boost defense.

3. **Light and Shadow Effects:**
   - Effects vary based on lighting conditions:
     - **Lighted Tiles:** Grant boosts.
     - **Shadowed Tiles:** Offer defensive advantages or debuffs.
     - **Partial Shadow:** Provides mixed effects.

4. **Unique Abilities by Tradition:**
   - Each tradition's puppets have unique abilities:
     - **Javanese Puppets:** Can increase nearby shadows for defense.
     - **Turkish Puppets:** Gain power in shadowed areas.
     - **Thai Puppets:** Move further on lighted tiles.
     - **Chinese Puppets:** Reveal nearby tile effects.

5. **Light Manipulation:**
   - Players can adjust the position or intensity of light sources, changing tile effects and strategies. Pieces adapt to light and shadow, adding strategic depth.

### **Light & Shadow Mechanics**

1. **Piece Transformation in Light or Shadow:**
   - Pieces can transform or “power up” in light or shadow, altering appearance and abilities:
     - **In Light:** Extra movement options or enhanced forms.
     - **In Shadow:** Evasive abilities or "concealed" states.

2. **Shadow Linking Between Pieces:**
   - Shadows of certain pieces can link, creating a network for enhanced defense or shared abilities.

3. **Shadow Trails:**
   - Moving pieces leave temporary shadow trails that provide buffs or debuffs to other pieces crossing them.

4. **Time-Based Light Shifts:**
   - Light sources shift periodically (e.g., every few turns), simulating a “day-night cycle” and affecting strategies.

5. **Cast Shadow Obstacles:**
   - Larger pieces cast longer shadows, creating temporary barriers or protected zones.

### **Light Manipulation Mechanics**

1. **Light-Controlling Pieces:**
   - Certain pieces can reposition the light source, strategically affecting illuminated or shadowed tiles.

2. **Light-Dampening or Intensifying Abilities:**
   - Pieces can dim or intensify light temporarily:
     - **Intensify:** Double buffs on illuminated tiles.
     - **Dim:** Reduce or eliminate light-based advantages.

3. **Shadow-Casting Pieces:**
   - Special pieces can cast shadows across multiple tiles, expanding the shadow zone for strategic purposes.

4. **Light-Seeking and Shadow-Fleeing Mechanics:**
   - **Light-Seeking Pieces:** Pull light closer, adjusting illuminated areas.
   - **Shadow-Fleeing Pieces:** Push light away, extending shadows.

5. **Light-Bending Abilities:**
   - Rare pieces can bend light into arcs or tunnels, selectively illuminating certain tiles or creating tactical opportunities.

6. **Light Traps and Reflections:**
   - Pieces can reflect light beams across tiles:
     - **Effects:** Stun opponents, weaken abilities, or reveal hidden tiles.
