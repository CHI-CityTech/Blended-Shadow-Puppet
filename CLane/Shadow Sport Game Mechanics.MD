Basic Mechanics 
1.Dynamic Board and Tile Effects:
2.Randomized Board: Each game generates a new board layout with different tile colors that provide effects based on lighting.
3.Tile Colors: Each color grants specific buffs or debuffs (e.g., red tiles boost attack, blue tiles boost defense).
4.Light and Shadow Effects: Each tile’s effect depends on whether it is in light, shadow, or partial shadow:
5.Lighted Tiles: Grant boosts.
6.Shadowed Tiles: Offer defensive advantages or debuffs.
7.Partial Shadow: Provides mixed effects.
8.Unique Abilities by Tradition:
  Each tradition’s puppets have unique abilities. For example:
      Javanese Puppets: Can increase nearby shadows for defense.
      Turkish Puppets: Gain power in shadowed areas.
      Thai Puppets: Move further on lighted tiles.
      Chinese Puppets: Reveal nearby tile effects.
9.Light Manipulation:
Players can adjust the position or intensity of light sources, changing tile effects and strategies. Pieces adapt to light and shadow, adding strategic depth.


Light & Shadow Mechanics 
1. Piece Transformation in Light or Shadow
Certain pieces could transform or “power up” based on whether they are in direct light or shadow, altering their appearance and abilities. For example, a piece could change to an “enlightened” form with extra movement options in direct light or become “concealed” with evasive abilities in shadow.
2. Shadow Linking Between Pieces
Shadows of specific pieces could “link” with others if they are close together, creating a network of shadows that enhances defensive power. This linking could allow pieces to share abilities or protect each other, adding another layer of cooperative strategy for defense.
3. Shadow Trails
As pieces move across the board, they could leave temporary shadow trails that affect any tile they’ve crossed. These shadow trails could provide brief defensive buffs or slow down opponent pieces, making movement decisions even more impactful.
4. Time-Based Light Shifts
The light source could shift periodically (e.g., every few turns), changing which tiles are illuminated or shadowed. This could create strategic moments where players must quickly adapt or reposition to take advantage of a new light pattern. It could also simulate a “day-night cycle” that brings special abilities into play at specific times.
5. Cast Shadow Obstacles
Some larger pieces could cast longer shadows, creating temporary “obstacles” that limit the movement of other pieces. These shadows could serve as barriers, blocking opponents or protecting certain areas of the board for a few turns.


Light Manipulation Mechanics 
1. Light-Controlling Pieces
Certain pieces could have abilities that allow them to move or rotate the light source. For example, a piece might be able to reposition the light in any direction within a limited range, affecting which tiles are illuminated or shadowed. This could create immediate strategic advantages by putting key opponent pieces in shadow or shifting light toward allies.
2. Light-Dampening or Intensifying Abilities
Some pieces might have the power to either dim or intensify the light for a certain number of turns. Intensifying the light could increase the effect of illuminated tiles (e.g., doubling buffs), while dimming it would reduce or eliminate light-based advantages, allowing a defensive playstyle when under attack.
3. Shadow-Casting Pieces
Larger or special pieces could cast their own shadows across multiple tiles, effectively expanding the “shadow zone” around them. By strategically placing these pieces, players could create protective shadows, block opponents, or even create specific paths across the board by overlapping shadows.
4. Light-Seeking and Shadow-Fleeing Mechanics
Certain pieces could have passive traits where they “pull” the light source closer to themselves each turn or naturally “repel” it. For example:
Light-Seeking: When these pieces move, they pull the light closer, adjusting the illuminated area.
Shadow-Fleeing: These pieces could push light away from themselves, extending shadows in the opposite direction and potentially limiting the opponent’s control over the board.
5. Light-Bending Abilities
A rare piece might be able to “bend” the light around it to create an arc or tunnel of light, illuminating only certain tiles in its path. This could serve to reveal hidden tiles, illuminate an ally while keeping others in shadow, or create tactical openings on the board.
6. Light Traps and Reflections
Certain pieces could act as “light reflectors,” setting up temporary beams that cast light across specific tiles. Opponents who move into these light beams might be temporarily stunned, weakened, or unable to use shadow-based abilities. This effect could add complexity, as players need to avoid or take advantage of these beams.
